The client, an environmental enthusiast and entrepreneur, approached me with a
vision to build a website that promotes sustainable practices through mobile
phone recycling. Their goal was to create a clean, minimalistic, and informative
platform that educates users on responsible e-waste disposal and encourages them
to recycle old or unwanted devices.

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges was designing a simple, intuitive flow for users to
evaluate their phone's condition and receive an instant quote—while maintaining
a static-page architecture to keep the site lightweight and fast. Another
challenge involved clearly communicating the process of shipping and approval,
to avoid confusion or user drop-off.

To address these, I designed a streamlined interface that walks users through
selecting their device, assessing its condition, and understanding the next
steps in a clear and engaging way. I focused on accessibility, clarity, and
responsiveness to ensure the platform worked well across devices.

The final product successfully delivered on the client's goals: an
easy-to-navigate, aesthetically pleasing website that supports both user
engagement and environmental impact.
