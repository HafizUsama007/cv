Preview URLs are a powerful feature for multi-tenant apps, allowing you to test
changes for each tenant before they go live. With Vercel's Next.js support, you
can create dynamic preview URLs for tenants (e.g.,
tenant1---project-git-branch.yourdomain.dev) to ensure a smooth development
workflow. In this post, we'll dive into setting up and troubleshooting
multi-tenant preview URLs.

## Why Use Preview URLs?

Preview URLs let you:

- Test tenant-specific changes without affecting the live site.
- Share previews with clients for feedback before deployment.
- Maintain a consistent development process across multiple tenants.

For example, a content platform like Hashnode or a SaaS tool like Instatus can
use preview URLs to show tenants how their site will look with new features.

## Setting Up Multi-Tenant Preview URLs

Vercel's Preview Deployment Suffixes make it easy to generate tenant-specific
preview URLs. Here's how:

### 1. Enable Preview Deployments:

In your Vercel project settings, ensure preview deployments are enabled for your
Git branches.

### 2. Configure Preview Suffixes:

Vercel supports dynamic subdomains like
`tenant1---<project-name>-git-<branch-name>.yourdomain.dev`. To set this up:

- Add a wildcard domain (e.g., `*.yourdomain.dev`) to your Vercel project.
- Point your domain to Vercel's nameservers (`ns1.vercel-dns.com`,
  `ns2.vercel-dns.com`) for SSL support.

### 3. Test Tenant Previews:

When you push changes to a branch, Vercel generates a preview URL for each
tenant. For example:

- `tenant1---my-multi-tenant-app-git-feature.yourdomain.dev`
- `tenant2---my-multi-tenant-app-git-feature.yourdomain.dev`

These URLs let you test the feature branch for each tenant independently.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Subdomain Length Limits**: DNS labels have a 63-character limit. Long branch
  names combined with tenant subdomains can cause resolution failures. Keep
  branch names short (e.g., `feat` instead of `feature-add-new-auth-system`).
- **Wildcard SSL Issues**: If preview URLs don't resolve, ensure your wildcard
  domain uses Vercel's nameservers. Without them, SSL certificates won't be
  issued.
- **DNS Propagation**: Preview URLs rely on DNS updates, which can take 24â€“48
  hours. Use WhatsMyDNS to verify propagation.
- **Misspelled Domains**: Double-check domain names in your Vercel settings to
  avoid routing errors.

## Best Practices

- **Automate Testing**: Use CI/CD pipelines to trigger preview deployments and
  validate tenant-specific changes.
- **Secure Previews**: Restrict access to preview URLs using Vercel's
  authentication features to protect sensitive tenant data.
- **Clean Up**: Remove unused preview URLs to avoid clutter and potential DNS
  issues.

With Vercel's preview URLs, you can deliver a robust development experience for
your multi-tenant app, ensuring each tenant's site is perfect before going live.
