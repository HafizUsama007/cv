Custom domains give your multi-tenant app a professional edge, allowing tenants
to use their own domains (e.g., customacmesite.com) instead of a subdomain
(e.g., tenant1.acme.com). With Vercel's powerful platform and Next.js, adding
and managing custom domains is straightforward. In this guide, we'll walk
through the process of programmatically adding custom domains, verifying
ownership, and handling redirects.

## Why Offer Custom Domains?

Custom domains enhance branding and trust. For example:

- A SaaS platform like Zapier lets clients use their own domains for a polished
  look.
- E-commerce builders like Super allow stores to operate under unique domains.
- Documentation platforms like Mintlify enable clients to brand their docs.

Vercel simplifies this by automatically issuing SSL certificates and managing
DNS routing, ensuring a seamless experience for your tenants.

## Step-by-Step: Adding a Custom Domain

Here's how to add a custom domain to your multi-tenant Next.js app using
Vercel's TypeScript SDK:

### 1. Initialize the Vercel SDK:

Set up the SDK with your Vercel API token, stored securely in an environment
variable.

### 2. Add the Domain Programmatically:

Use the `projectsAddProjectDomain` function to associate the tenant's domain
with your Vercel project. For example:

```typescript
import { VercelCore as Vercel } from '@vercel/sdk/core.js'
import { projectsAddProjectDomain } from '@vercel/sdk/funcs/projectsAddProjectDomain.js'

const vercel = new Vercel({
  bearerToken: process.env.VERCEL_TOKEN
})

await projectsAddProjectDomain(vercel, {
  idOrName: 'my-multi-tenant-app',
  teamId: 'team_1234',
  requestBody: {
    name: 'customacmesite.com'
  }
})
```

This adds customacmesite.com to your project, and Vercel begins the SSL
certificate process.

### 3. Verify Domain Ownership:

To ensure the tenant owns the domain, check its verification status and prompt
them to add a TXT record if needed:

```typescript
import { VercelCore as Vercel } from '@vercel/sdk/core.js'
import { projectsGetProjectDomain } from '@vercel/sdk/funcs/projectsGetProjectDomain.js'
import { projectsVerifyProjectDomain } from '@vercel/sdk/funcs/projectsVerifyProjectDomain.js'

const vercel = new Vercel({
  bearerToken: process.env.VERCEL_TOKEN
})

const domain = 'customacmesite.com'

const [domainResponse, verifyResponse] = await Promise.all([
  projectsGetProjectDomain(vercel, {
    idOrName: 'my-multi-tenant-app',
    teamId: 'team_1234',
    domain
  }),
  projectsVerifyProjectDomain(vercel, {
    idOrName: 'my-multi-tenant-app',
    teamId: 'team_1234',
    domain
  })
])

const { value: result } = verifyResponse

if (!result?.verified) {
  console.log(`Domain verification required for ${domain}.`)
  // Prompt tenant to add TXT record
}
```

### 4. Handle Redirects:

To avoid duplicate content, redirect www.customacmesite.com to
customacmesite.com (or vice versa). Add both domains to your project and
configure the redirect in Vercel's dashboard or via the API.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Verification Issues**: If SSL certificates aren't issued, double-check that
  the tenant has added the correct TXT record or switched to Vercel's
  nameservers.
- **DNS Delays**: Domain changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate. Monitor
  with WhatsMyDNS.
- **SEO Concerns**: Use canonical URLs to indicate the primary domain and
  prevent search engine penalties.

By offering custom domains, you empower your tenants to create branded
experiences while keeping your infrastructure simple. Start building with Vercel
