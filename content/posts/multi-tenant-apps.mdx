Multi-tenant applications are revolutionizing how developers build and deploy
web platforms. By serving multiple customers (tenants) from a single codebase,
you can streamline infrastructure, reduce costs, and deliver branded experiences
across domains or subdomains. Platforms like Zapier, Hashnode, and Super
leverage this approach, and with tools like Next.js and Vercel, you can too. In
this post, we'll explore why multi-tenant apps are a game-changer and how to get
started.

## What Makes Multi-Tenant Apps Special?

A multi-tenant app allows you to host multiple clients—each with their own
domain (e.g., tenantcustomdomain.com) or subdomain (e.g.,
tenant1.acme.com)—under one Next.js deployment. This setup offers:

- **Scalability**: Manage one codebase instead of multiple deployments.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduce server and maintenance overhead.
- **Branding Flexibility**: Support custom domains for premium clients while
  offering subdomains for others.
- **Seamless SSL and DNS**: Vercel handles SSL certificates and DNS routing
  automatically, ensuring low-latency responses via its Anycast network.

Popular use cases include content platforms (e.g., Read.cv), e-commerce builders
(e.g., Typedream), and B2B SaaS tools (e.g., Cal). Whether you're building a
blog platform or a SaaS product, multi-tenancy simplifies growth.

## Getting Started with Next.js and Vercel

To build a multi-tenant app:

1. **Set Up Your Next.js Project**: Create a Next.js app and deploy it on
   Vercel.
2. **Configure Domains**: Add your apex domain (e.g., acme.com) and a wildcard
   domain (e.g., \*.acme.com) in Vercel's project settings. Point your domain to
   Vercel's nameservers (ns1.vercel-dns.com, ns2.vercel-dns.com) for wildcard
   SSL support.
3. **Handle Tenant Domains**: Use Vercel's TypeScript SDK to programmatically
   add custom domains for tenants. For example, you can add customacmesite.com
   to your project and trigger SSL certificate generation.
4. **Verify Ownership**: Ensure tenants verify their custom domains by adding
   TXT records, as unverified domains won't receive SSL certificates.

## Pro Tip: Avoid Common Pitfalls

- **DNS Propagation**: DNS changes can take 24–48 hours. Use tools like
  WhatsMyDNS to monitor progress.
- **SEO Duplicate Content**: If a tenant uses both a subdomain and a custom
  domain, set a canonical URL or redirect to the primary domain to avoid SEO
  penalties.
- **Wildcard Domains**: Always use Vercel's nameservers for wildcard subdomains
  to enable automatic SSL.

Ready to scale your app? Multi-tenant architecture with Next.js and Vercel is
your ticket to efficient, branded, and scalable web development.
